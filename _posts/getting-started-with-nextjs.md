# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that provides a great developer experience with all the features you need for production. In this post, I'll guide you through the basics of getting started with Next.js.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as:

- Server-side rendering
- Static site generation
- API routes
- File-based routing
- Built-in CSS support
- Fast refresh
- Image optimization

## Setting Up a Next.js Project

Getting started with Next.js is simple. You can create a new project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
# or
yarn create next-app my-next-app
# or
pnpm create next-app my-next-app
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with a basic structure. Once it's done, you can navigate to the project directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Your application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## File-Based Routing

Next.js has a file-based routing system. Files in the `pages` directory (or `app` directory if using the App Router) automatically become routes.

For example:

- `pages/index.js` → `/`
- `pages/about.js` → `/about`
- `pages/blog/[slug].js` → `/blog/:slug`

## Creating Your First Page

Let's create a simple page in Next.js:

```jsx
// pages/index.js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Home() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <h1>Welcome to My Next.js App</h1>
      <p>You've clicked the button {count} times.</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

One of Next.js's powerful features is Static Site Generation. You can pre-render pages at build time:

```jsx
// pages/posts/[id].js
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const post = await getPostById(params.id);
  return {
    props: { post },
  };
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await getAllPosts();
  return {
    paths: posts.map((post) => ({ params: { id: post.id } })),
    fallback: false,
  };
}

export default function Post({ post }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.content }} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js provides a great framework for building modern web applications. This post just scratches the surface of what's possible. In future posts, I'll dive deeper into more advanced features like API routes, middleware, authentication, and deployment strategies.
